### Hi! How are you today?

Creating this landing page for my Github account is the last task I have to perform to complete the Data Science Bootcamp I have been on since March 2023.
I have been learning about Python and related data science tools, Machine Learning and a little about AI. But then, who isn't learning about AI at the moment?

I have had a varied career, but I mostly identify as a Software Engineer. I decided to study Data Science to give myself a new challenge and to open up some interesting new opportunities. Time will tell...

I started to compose(?) my own music a couple of years ago. If you like music, you might want to avoid my SoundCloud account, but if your brave you can find it here: https://soundcloud.com/andygibbons
